Case Study

From the list of instagram handles obtained when searched for ‘food’. Opened the first 10 handles and extracted the top 5 which have the highest number of followers.
Extracted the number of posts these handles have done in the previous 3 days.
Opened the 5 handles you obtained earlier, and scraped the content of the first 10 posts of each handle.
